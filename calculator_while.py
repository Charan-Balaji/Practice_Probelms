#Youâ€Ÿre tasked with creating a simple calculator using a while loop and a switch statement. Your program should repeatedly prompt the user to choose an arithmetic operation
#like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) and then perform the selected operation based on user input. How will you set up your while loop and 
# switch case to keep the calculator running until the user decides to exit.
